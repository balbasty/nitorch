    The polygon or surface *must* be closed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : (..., dim) tensor
        Coordinates of points to test
    vertices : (nv, dim) tensor
        Vertex coordinates
    faces : (nf, dim) tensor[int]
        Faces are encoded by the indices of its vertices.

    # This function uses a ray-tracing technique:

    #   A half-line is started in each point. If it crosses an even
    #   number of faces, it is inside the shape. If it crosses an even
    #   number of faces, it is not.
    #
    #   In practice, we loop through faces (as we expect there are much
    #   less vertices than voxels) and compute intersection points between
    #   all lines and each face in a batched fashion. We only want to
    #   send these rays in one direction, so we keep aside points whose
    #   intersection have a positive coordinate along the ray.
