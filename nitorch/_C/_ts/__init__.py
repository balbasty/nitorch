"""
TorchScript implementation of the low-level push/pull utilities.
The idea is to eventually have an alternate implementation that does not
require compiling C++/CUDA code. The compiled version could still be
installed [optionally] by the setup script, since it is expected to be
much faster than the TorchScript version.
